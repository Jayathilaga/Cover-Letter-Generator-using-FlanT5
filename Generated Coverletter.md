Dear Hiring Manager, 

As an individual with a desire to work at a hospital where the health of the patients is top priority, I am eager to begin working at the hospital that will best serve
your patients. I am excited to be employed at Saint Mary's Health System, and I look forward to fulfilling this need for a medical records clerk. I work in medical
records departments in hospitals and have worked in other departments. I am capable of working with both doctors and other staff members to ensure that the medical
records are up to date and that they are completely complete. I have an interest in helping to keep our patients as safe and secure as I can. I have a desire to continue
my career at the hospital. I have spent five years in medical records departments in several hospitals, so I will bring some of my knowledge and skill that I gained from
that time. I enjoy working with the nursing staff to ensure that the records of patients are accurate and up to date and will always do my best to help the other staff
members that I work with. This experience allows me to help doctors and other medical staff when necessary. The hospital is looking to hire someone who will take a team
approach as a means of ensuring the success of the hospital, as a whole and a particular department within the hospital. I am a student at St. Helena University, and
have a nursing degree. As such, although my education is not directly related to the medical records office, I have gained some knowledge that may benefit the hospital
and the staff. I believe I can bring a great deal of experience and knowledge to the job. I am confident that the hospital is a great place to live and a great place for
me to find employment. Thank you so much for your consideration of my application and would love to learn more about Saint Mary's Health System. I look forward to
meeting with you and discussing more about the position and what it will be like for my future at the hospital. As a new and dedicated member of the hospital team, I
hope to see you in person soon to begin the journey of becoming a great part of the team.


Thanks again for your time.
I look forward to hearing from you soon,

Take care!
Amy Chan,
